## Assignment no. 07

### Aim: To Study of Arrays.


1.  Write a C program to implement following scenario by using Array
	
An election is contested by five candidates. The candidates are numbered 1 to 5 and the voting is done by marking the candidate number on the ballot paper. Write a program to read the ballots and counts the votes cast for each candidates using an array variable count. In case, a number read is outside the range 1 to 5, the ballot should be considered as a 'spoilt ballot' and the program should also count the number of spoilt ballots.

2.  Write a C Program to find inverse of 3 X 3 Matrix

3. Write a C Program to check whether matrix is magic square or not? 

What is Magic Square? 
1. A magic square is a simple mathematical game developed during the 1500. 
2. Square is divided into equal number of rows and columns. 
3. Start filling each square with the number from 1 to num (where num = No of Rows X No of Columns) 4. You can only use a number once. 
5. Fill each square so that the sum of each row is the same as the sum of each column. 
6. In the example shown here, the sum of each row is 15, and the sum of each column is also 15. 
7. in this Example: The numbers from 1 through 9 is used only once. This is called a magic square.
