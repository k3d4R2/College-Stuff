## Assignment No 10
### Aim: To Study Concept of Structures

1. Write a program to implement Structure in C.
- Create any structure
- Initialize, access and display elements from structure (with scanf function)

	
2.  Write a sample C program to implement nested structure.

3. Write a sample C program to implement array in structure.

4. Write a sample C program to implement function in structure.

5. Write C program to store and display the name, runs scored and wickets taken by a cricket player   using structure.

6.  Write C program to create following records using Structure
      
   - 6.1 Student: regno, student_name, DOB,age, address 
    (Implement using nested structure for name(first_name,Middle_name,Last_name),address(flat_number, lane_number,pin_code,city),DOB(date,month,year)

   - 6.2 Book: bookid, bookname, author, price, edition, publisher, year

   - 6.3 Employee: employeeid, employee_name, DOB, age, sex, dateofbirth,address,basicpay
(Implement using nested structure for employee_name(first_name,Middle_name,Last_name),address(flat_number, lane_number,pin_code,city),DOB(date,month,year)

7.  Write a C program to add two distances (feet-inch system) entered by user. To solve this program, make a structure. Pass two structure variable (containing distance in feet and inch) to add function by reference and display the result in main function without returning it.
